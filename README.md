# Decentralized Storage System with Incentives

Welcome to the Decentralized Storage System project! This project aims to leverage the power of decentralized systems, allowing users to store and pin data in a distributed fashion. We utilize the IPFS protocol for pinning data and libp2p for seamless peer-to-peer transfers. What's unique about our system? We offer custom incentives for participants who store and pin data on their local computers!

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Utilize IPFS for effective and decentralized data storage.
- **Peer-to-Peer Transfers:** Leverage libp2p for efficient data transfer among peers.
- **Incentivization System:** Get rewarded for contributing to the network by pinning and storing data.

## Technologies Used

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) - For decentralized storage and pinning of data. [IPFS Documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/)
- [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) - A modular network stack that allows peer-to-peer networking for any system. [libp2p Documentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - For building our user interface. [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
